### Before We Begin

This tutorial assumes that you are developing for the **.NET Framework**. If you want to use Awesomium with a C++ Application, then you'll need to follow our C++ tutorial instead.

### Checklist
You will need the following:

* The **Awesomium SDK** (download it [here](http://www.awesomium.com/download/))
* The **Mono Runtime** (download it [here](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html))


### Installing the SDK
