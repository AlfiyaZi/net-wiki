##### *Awesomium.Windows.Controls* (WPF)

#### Modified API:

##### *Awesomium.Unity*

* `IResourceInterceptor` and `INavigationInterceptor` service, are **removed** from Unity (required features not supported by Mono).


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug within WebKit that caused GDI handles to constantly increase in main process. (Fix in native Awesomium)
* Fixed issues that would cause JavaScript dialogs in in the global scope or inline scripts, not be intercepted.
* Fixed a `NotSupportedException` that could be thrown when using a WPF or WinForms `WebSessionProvider` with child view.
* Fixed issue when handling multiple and simultaneous JavaScript `window.open` calls.

##### JavaScript (JIF)

* Fixed remaining "awejif is not defined" that occured in several occassions.

##### Unity

* Fixed focusing issues that would cause *"Bring In Front"* in GUI `WebUIComponent` instances to fail.
* Fixed issue that would cause the plugin and all components stop working when changing scenes.

##### MonoMac

* Fixed Awesomium framework bundle embedding issues with distributed MonoMac samples.


### Changes in Samples

* Minor improvements to *BasicSample*.
* (Unity) Improved the behavior of the address-box in the Unity *AwesomiumSample* scene.
* (WPF) Fixed issue in the *TabbedWPFSample* that would cause links in child windows (`PopupWindow`) not work appropriately.


### Known Issues

* On **Windows 8**, **WebGL** is currently not supported.


#### Under production:

* When you are using the OSX `OSMWebView`, drop-down (popup) menus (e.g., HTML: `<select>`), are not displayed automatically. Predefined drop-down (popup) menus have been added to the WPF `WebControl` and the Windows Forms `WebControl` but not to the MonoMac `OSMWebView` yet. However, the new powerful API allows you to design and display these yourself, by handling the [`ShowPopupMenu`](http://docs.awesomium.net/?tc=E_Awesomium_Core_IWebView_ShowPopupMenu) event.
